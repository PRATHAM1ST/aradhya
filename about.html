                    A chef is in charge of the kitchen in restaurants or other places where food is served. They watch all activity and food preparation with any staff that would assist in the kitchen. They supervise the preparation of food for its garnishing and presentation, as well as, the seasonings for a perfect taste.

                <p>A chef would coach and develop other staff in the kitchen to improve their skills. Because a kitchen depends on a cooperative team effort, the chef or head cook would encourage staff to have mutual respect and trust for each other. A chef or head cook can be found working in restaurants, private households, hotels, casinos or other food service places. They work a variety of hours, such as, early morning, late evenings, holidays, and weekends. This occupation is very fast-paced and normally has full-time hours. You should expect strong competition especially at upscale restaurants, casinos, or hotels because of the higher salary paid in these places.</p>
